# Bitbucket doesn't have access tokens like GitHub or GitLab.
# You can of course grant access to a repository with an SSH key,
# but on cheap shared hosting you usually can't configure SSH.
#
# As a workaround, you can create an OAuth consumer on the workspace level
# and grant him read access to the whole workspace, and with that you
# can clone over HTTPS by providing the token in the URL GitHub/GitLab-like.
#
# The only drawback is that you have to regenerate this token after a few hours.
# This script helps with that by regenerating the token before executing a command.
#
# To create an OAuth token on Bitbucket, go to the workspace settings -> OAuth consumers ->
# Add consumer -> Name: production -> Callback URL: whatever ->
# Check: This is a private consumer -> Permissions: Repositories / read
#
# Take note of Key and Secret given to you by Bitbucket.
#
# Now you can use this script like this:
# bin/bitbucket-git clone <key> <secret> <user/repo.git>
#
# For example:
# bin/bitbucket-git pull 8K9zDMhPcMZoyks9SM bMmzRJlh3hVDPeytLRgqOsrDnuEtvhDK you/therepo.git
#
# Don't forget to update the "git pull" command in Goji in src/Admin/Controller/XhrUpdateController.class.php
