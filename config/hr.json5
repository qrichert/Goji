{
	// Represents a single person visiting the site, logged in or not.
	// If not set, uses the default \Goji\HumanResources\User

	// List of roles available, with string identifier and power lever
	// Here (default), editor (5) has more rights than member (1), but less than admin (7)
	// So that if a member is an editor and you do $this->m_app->getMemberManager()->memberIs('admin') it
	// would return 'false' (5 <= 7), but memberIs('member') would return 'true' (5 >= 1) and memberIs('editor')
	// would return 'true' as well (5 >= 5)
	// Always use (string) id and (int) value (/!\ 'any' is a reserved keyword)
	//roles: {
	//	member: 1, // "1" is used as default role when someone signs up (see: MemberManager::moveTemporaryMemberToPermanentList())
	//	editor: 5,
	//	admin: 7
	//},

	// Query to get member role from database ('%{ID}' will be replaced by the current member's id)
	// If not set, 'SELECT role FROM g_member WHERE id=%{ID}' will be used
	//member_role_query: "SELECT role FROM g_member WHERE id=%{ID}"
