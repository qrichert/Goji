Basic Flow
==========

1. [Request Chain](#request-chain)
2. [App](#app)
3. [Controllers](#controllers)

Request Chain
-------------

Requests follow this path:

`.htaccess` &rarr; `index.php` &rarr; `App.class.php` &rarr; `YourController.class.php`

There are also requests to static files that go like this:

`.htaccess` &rarr; `static.php`.

App
---

`App` is to Goji what mayonnaise is to a sandwich.

It keeps it all together. It is the link between all the the different parts.

Of course, you don't have to use this class, and go through the following process manuallyâ€”*i.e.*
call the different objects by hand. `App` is here for convenience and covers most use cases,
but if you want to do something specific, you can just omit it.

```php
$app = new App();
    $app->createDataBase();
    $app->exec();
```

Basically what this does it load the database from your config file and starts the routing process.

The database will be accessible via `App::getDataBase(): PDO`. Really it's a `\Goji\Core\DataBase`
object which is returned, but that's just a child of PDO that reads your config file. So really it's
just a regular `PDO`. If you don't use a database, just remove the second line.

App automatically uses a `\Goji\Core\RequestHandler` object, accessible via `App::getRequestHandler(): RequestHandler`.
`RequestHandler` analyzes the HTTP request and extracts (and sanitizes) some useful information like
the request URI, request page, raw query string, query string as array, script name, root folder, etc. 

`$app->exec()` starts the routing process. The routing ends ends by calling the `render()` method of
your controller. It goes like this:

1. Create a `\Goji\Core\Languages` object. Accessible via `App::getLanguages(): Languages`. This class
   handles language preferences. It takes the languages accepted by the browser and those supported by
   you app and finds the best match.
2. Create a `\Goji\Core\Router` object. Accessible via `App::getRouter(): Router`.
3. Call `Router::route()`.
	- If everything is okay, `Router` will match the request path with the routes you have set in your
	  config file. Once the right route is found, `Router` calls the `render()` method of the appropriate
	  controller.
	- If there's an error somewhere (like a 404), `Router::requestErrorDocument()` will be called which
	  will ultimately render the `\App\Controller\HttpErrorController` (that you can modify because it's
	  not part of the lib, it's in the `/src/controller/` folder).

Controllers
-----------

Controllers must:

1. Be in the `\App\Controller` namespace
2. Implement the `Goji\Blueprints\ControllerInterface` interface, so:
	- Have a `public function __construct(App $app);` method
	- Have a `public function render();` method

Usually you want to have a `$this->m_app` attribute, so you can access the main `App` object from your
controller, but you're not forced to use it. On the other hand, what is required is to accept an `App`
object as paramater, since `Router` passes the `App` object to the controller constructor, like:

```php
$controller = new \App\Controller\YourController($app);
    $controller->render();
```

The `render()` method is also mandatory, since `Router` calls this method automatically (as shown above).
`render()` is where you should call your model and your view.
